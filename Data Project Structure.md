1. Data Set - mention the source of the dataset (data.world). Describe the dataset: how many rows and columns does it have, number of values, what are these values about, what is the time range they've been collected for.
2. Process-flow in the project:
   1. Understand the problem/Ask interesting questions
   2. Data gathering and preparation
   3. Data analysis
